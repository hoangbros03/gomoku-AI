# Gomoku AI Project

This is a fun project to make a engine which can play AI clever. 

To play, simply clone this repository and type `python main.py` in your terminal.

The current version has a board size of 15x15 and depth of 3. In the future, I plan to update the game so that players can choose the board size and depth via command line arguments.
## Technology

Using only Python and Numpy for optimizing the speed. Relying heavily on heuristic score calculation which is based on paper UCT-ADP Progressive Bias Algorithm for Solving Gomoku of Xu Cao and Yanghao Lin.
